Analysis:

Method: get(int index) --
ArrayList -- O(1)
LinkedList -- O(n)
Explanation:
The ArrayList would be more efficient for the get(int index) method, as it has a significantly faster runtime with a BigO
of O(1) compared to the LinkedList's O(n). For the LinkedList, we have to loop through the elements and increment an index variable while
in ArrayList, each spot has an index & we can quickly loop up what's in that spot.

Method: rotate(int n)
ArrayList -- O(n)
LinkedList -- O(n)
Explanation:
For both, we iterated through n number of times & set the last n elements to the beginning.
In ArrayList, we move the last element to the beginning & shift the rest down one spot n times
whereas in LinkedList, we found the nth to the last element & moved everything after to the beginning.

Method: merge(List<T> otherList)
ArrayList -- O(n)
LinkedList -- O(n)
Explanation:
Both have a runtime of O(n) because we iterate through all of the elements in this list and the other list only once
& we're just repeatedly adding the lower values to the new list until we've gotten through all the elements. From there,
we just added on whatever was left to the end !!


Method: reverse()
ArrayList -- O(n)
LinkedList -- O(n)
Explanation:
Again, both of these also have a runtime of O(n). For the ArrayList, we're iterating through the first half and swapping
with the last half -- technically O(n/2) but that's just O(n). As for the LinkedList, we've just repointed the next arrows
to the previous Node until we reach the end.
